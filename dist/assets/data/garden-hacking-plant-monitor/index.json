It's January. It's cold. I'm cold. The cat is cold, and my permafrosted car has a small family of penguins who've made themselves at home in the boot. ¬† Whilst it is cold, and the days are still short, it is also the recommended time to plant chili seeds for the year - especially the hotter varieties.</p>\n<p>I've never done early planting and I'm worried about the heat (or lack thereof) and also I'm pretty forgetful when it comes to watering schedules. ¬†The later is not a big problem as forgetting to water plants is fine in Scotland when they live outside as it rains a fair bit.</p>\n<p>What's a geek to do with all this worry?

So far the iterations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local monitoring using the standard Espurino board.

The temperature sensor takes its power from the 3.3v rail, but the soil moisture sensor takes its power from the B9 pin which is turned on for one second before taking the reading and then turned off. This is to conserve the sensor as keeping it on corrodes the sensor. ¬†To follow along with the pins, see the pinout diagram on the <a href=\"http://www.espruino.com/WiFi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Espruino WiFi page</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"soil-sensor-analog-output\"><a href=\"#soil-sensor-analog-output\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Soil Sensor (Analog output)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>VCC - straight to pin B9</li>\n<li>GND - ground rail</li>\n<li>DO - <em>not used</em></li>\n<li>AO - straight to pin B0</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"temperature-sensor\"><a href=\"#temperature-sensor\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Temperature Sensor</h4>\n<p>With the rounded side facing <strong><em>away</em></strong> from left to right:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0 - Ground rail</li>\n<li>1 - pin B1</li>\n<li>2 - 3.3v rail</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> You need to put the 4.7K resistor between pins 1 &#x26; 2 (data and power)</p>\n<h4 id=\"configuration\"><a href=\"#configuration\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Configuration</h4>\n<p>The server endpoint details and token details are in a \"module\".
