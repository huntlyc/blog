If you have a list of objects like so:

```javascript
    const readings = [
      {temp: 40.3, stage: 'preferment'},
      {temp: 10.1, stage: 'post fridge retardation'},
      {temp: 20.1, stage: 'pre oven'}
    ];
```

If you want to sort this list by `temp` and you try and run `readings.sort()` nothing will happen - it will return the array in same order as JS doesn't know what you're trying to do. Â To help, you need to provide a custom compare function to sort. Â A basic compare function to compare two numbers (*a*, and *b*) looks like this:

```javascript
  function myCompare(a,b){
    if(a > b) return 1;
    if(a < b) return -1;
    if(a === b) return 0;
  }
```

All we need to do is tell this function to use our desired key:

```javascript
  function tempCompare(a,b){
    const x = a.temp;
    const y = b.temp;

    if(x > y) return 1;
    if(x < y) return -1;
    if(x === y) return 0;
  }
```

Now we can run `readings.sort(tempCompare)` and you'll now have the following:

```javascript
  [
    {temp: 10.1, stage: "post fridge retardation"},
    {temp: 20.1, stage: "pre oven"},
    {temp: 40.3, stage: "preferment"}
  ];
```

If you wanted this list in descending order then you alter the return values in the `tempCompare(a,b)` function like so:

```javascript
  function tempCompareDesc(a,b){
    const x = a.temp;
    const y = b.temp;

    if(x > y) return -1; //This is now -1 instead of 1
    if(x < y) return 1; //This is now 1 instead of -1
    if(x === y) return 0;
    }
```

Then you'll have:

```javascript
  [
    {temp: 40.3, stage: "preferment"},
    {temp: 20.1, stage: "pre oven"},
    {temp: 10.1, stage: "post fridge retardation"}
  ]
```
